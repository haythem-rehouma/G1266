Each operation can be processed by one or multiple machines.\n","\n","####**Optimization Objectives**:\n","-\t**Minimizing Tardiness:** The agent aims to minimize the average tardiness of all jobs, which is the delay in completion beyond the due date.\n","\n","**Reward Function:** The reward function is aligned with the problem objective, designed as the tardiness rate\\\\\n","\n","####**Disruptions:**\n","We assume that $N_a$ new jobs arrive in the system according to a Poisson process, with interarrival times following an exponential distribution. This distribution is governed by the parameter 𝜆, which represents the expected time between the arrival of two consecutive jobs. \\\\\n","For a job $𝐽_𝑖$ consisting of $𝑛_𝑖$ operations arriving at time $𝐴_𝑖$, the due date $𝐷_𝑖$ is calculated using the formula:\n","$D_i=\\ A_i+\\left(\\sum_{1\\le j\\le n_i}{\\bar{p}}_{i,j}\\right).DDT$ \\\\\n","Here, ${\\bar{p}}_{i,j}={mean}_{M_k\\in\\mathcal{M}_{i,j}}p_{i,j,k}$ represents the average processing time of operation $O_{i,j}$ across all compatible machines, and DDT (Due Date Tightness) indicates the slack time tightness from a job’s arrival to its due date. \\\\\n","\n","####**DQN Actions:**\n","The actions taken by the DQN are structured as follows:\n","-\t**Heuristic Integration:** The environment supports the use of 10 heuristic policies, such as :\n"," - *Shortest Processing Time (SPT)*,\n"," - *Earliest Due Date (EDD)*,\n"," - *Minimal Critical Ratio (MCR)*,\n"," - *Most Remaining Time (MRT)*,\n"," - *Least Remaining Time (LRT)*.\n"," - *Smallest Slack Time (SLK)*.\n","\n","A decision time $t$ is defined as every time a new job is inserted or cancelled or a machine completes an in-process operation.\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"pfmGGeZ3kVbK"},"source":["**The state space of DQN includes the following features:**\n","- Actual tardiness rate
